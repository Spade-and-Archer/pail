A python application to fetch and sort email

This was my first ever program. I actually thought I lost it until I went through my GitHub Repos looking for something. It is an incredibly naive attempt to create a program that fetches email. I originally made this in, I believe, Grade 9 and updated it in grade 10 to be much more readable and easier to debug. At this point, I am keeping this purely for nostalgia purposes.

I would mark this private if I had a pro membership. As it is, just have fun.
