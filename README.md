A python application to fetch and sort email

This was my first ever program. I actually thought I lost it until I went through my GitHub Repos looking for something. It is an incredibly naive attempt to create a program that fetches email. The entire thing is one continuous function. At the time I was not familiar with good name conventions, and re-factoring was not something anyone had told me about. I believe I was in grade 9 or 10. If you are looking for laughs, you will find a few. If you are looking for good code, you are in the wrong place.

I would mark this private if I had a pro membership. As it is, just have fun.
